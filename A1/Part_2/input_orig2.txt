as they rounded a bend in the path that ran beside the river lara recognized the silhouette of a fig tree atop a nearby hill the weather was hot and the days were long the fig tree was in full leaf but not yet bearing fruit
soon lara spotted other landmarksan outcropping of limestone beside the path that had a silhouette like a mans face a marshy spot beside the river where the waterfowl were easily startled a tall tree that looked like a man with his arms upraised they were drawing near to the place where there was an island in the river the island was a good spot to make camp they would sleep on the island tonight
lara had been back and forth along the river path many times in her short life her people had not created the pathit had always been there like the riverbut their deerskinshod feet and the wooden wheels of their handcarts kept the path well worn laras people were salt traders and their livelihood took them on a continual journey
at the mouth of the river the little group of half a dozen intermingled families gathered salt from the great salt beds beside the sea they groomed and sifted the salt and loaded it into handcarts when the carts were full most of the group would stay behind taking shelter amid rocks and simple leantos while a band of fifteen or so of the heartier members set out on the path that ran alongside the river
with their precious cargo of salt the travelers crossed the coastal lowlands and traveled toward the mountains but laras people never reached the mountaintops they traveled only as far as the foothills many people lived in the forests and grassy meadows of the foothills gathered in small villages in return for salt these people would give laras people dried meat animal skins cloth spun from wool clay pots needles and scraping tools carved from bone and little toys made of wood
their bartering done lara and her people would travel back down the river path to the sea the cycle would begin again
it had always been like this lara knew no other life she traveled back and forth up and down the river path no single place was home she liked the seaside where there was always fish to eat and the gentle lapping of the waves lulled her to sleep at night she was less fond of the foothills where the path grew steep the nights could be cold and views of great distances made her dizzy she felt uneasy in the villages and was often shy around strangers the path itself was where she felt most at home she loved the smell of the river on a hot day and the croaking of frogs at night vines grew amid the lush foliage along the river with berries that were good to eat even on the hottest day sundown brought a cool breeze off the water which sighed and sang amid the reeds and tall grasses
